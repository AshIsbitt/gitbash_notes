# Task and Time Management

## Time management
The range of skills, tools and techniques utilised to accomplish specific tasks, projects and goals.

<b>Time-boxing</b>
- Dedicating a specific time period for a task. (EG: School lessons with a set length of an hour etc.)
- Allows for increased focus
- Becomes more time focussed
- Quick results motivate you more
- Works best along with a calendar – visual mark up of time-boxing

<b>Good meetings</b>
- Selecting who’s invited – don’t waste people’s time
- Set goals/objectives for the meeting
- Set Agenda
- Keep control of the meeting.
- Decisions need to be made during the meeting.
- Someone should take minutes.

The number one rule:
<b>DON'T WASTE PEOPLE'S TIME</b>

## Task Management

The process of managing a task during its lifecycle, including planning, tracking and reporting

<b>The Eisenhower Model</b> -
<i>How urgent is this task? How important is this task?” </i>

- Urgent+Important = Necessity
- Not urgent + important = Quality
- Urgent + Not Important = Deception
- Not Urgent + Not Important = Waste

<b>Pareto Principle</b> – the 20/80 rule – 80% of all the land is owned by 20% of the people in Italy. This can apply to a number of places. 80% of the bugs will come from 20% of the code, etc. (The one thing that’s causing all the issues, or all the costs etc.)
