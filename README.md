## Bash
Bash is short for the "Bourne again shell", and is used to control a UNIX-based OS through a Command Line Interface. As with Git, there are a number of commands that allow for a range of functionality.

- <b>PWD</b> - Used to display the current location in the file tree
- <b>CD</b> - Used to change directory location. This can be with an absolute or relative path.
- <b>LS</b> - Used to list the contents of the current directory
- <b>MKDIR</b> - Used to create a new directory
- <b>TOUCH</b> - Used to make a new file. Any file extention can be specified.
- <b>ECHO</b> - Used to outpu text in the console.
- <b>CAT</b> - Used to print text from a file, or to combine multiple files. (Short for Concatenate)
- <b>OPEN</b> - Used to open a program from the current directory
- <b>CLEAR</b>s - Used to clear the console

It's also worth noting that the ~ symbol is used to represent the home directory, and / is used to represent the root directory. For example, <i>CD ~</i> will send the user to the home directory.
